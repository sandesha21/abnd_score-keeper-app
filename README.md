ABND- Score Keeper App- Project 2

Build a Score Keeper app, which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course:

    ● Adding button code to your app
    
    ● Updating views
    
    ● Properly scoping variables
    
    ● Finding views by their ID
